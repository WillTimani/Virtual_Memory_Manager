# Virtual_Memory_Manager

C++ program that virtualizes the managing of memory in a computer. Reads and converts logical and physical addresses, pages into RAM, reads from RAM via page table and TLB and handles page replacement using FIFO and LRU methods.

Each file represents a component of memory management. At the top of each file will be labeled SOFTWARE or HARDWARE. Since the entirity of this project is software, these labels serve the purpose of representing where each component of memory managment would actually take place.
